## SUBJECT: Request for GRECO Evaluation – Systemic Anti-Corruption Failures in Serbia: Immunity Abuse, Institutional Capture, and €450M+ Documented Corruption (2014-2025)

Dear GRECO President and Evaluation Team,

I hereby submit a formal request for **extraordinary GRECO evaluation** of Serbian anti-corruption institutional framework, documenting:

1. **Systematic immunity abuse** preventing prosecution of €450M+ in documented corruption
2. **Institutional capture** of prosecutor's office and courts by accused parties
3. **Policy-driven institutional dysfunction** causing preventable deaths (13 documented) and systematic exclusion of 60,000 citizens from social protection
4. **Failure of EU monitoring mechanisms** to prevent or report systematic violations
5. **Complete absence of accountability** for high-level corruption spanning 11 years

This request seeks GRECO evaluation under:
- **GRECO Evaluation Methodology** (Anti-corruption institutional framework assessment)
- **Council of Europe Convention on Corruption** (1997 and 1999 protocols)
- **UNCAC Monitoring Framework** (UN Convention Against Corruption)
- **ECHR Standards** (European Convention on Human Rights, Article 6 – right to fair trial)

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE DOCUMENTATION

### A. Scale of Corruption

| Category | Documented Amount | Victims | Institutional Responsibility |
|----------|------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Healthcare fraud** | €8.9M (respirators undelivered) | 400 patients unable to access equipment | RFZO + Health Ministry |
| **Phantom procurement** | €18M (non-existent companies) | Entire healthcare system (digitalization failure) | Finance Ministry + Health Ministry |
| **Privatization-driven deaths** | €25M+ (institutional policy) | 13 deaths in fires; 8,617 in unregulated private sector | Health Ministry (Lončar 2016-2020) |
| **Social protection exclusion** | €3M (algorithmic discrimination) | 60,000 citizens excluded from assistance | Social Ministry + RFZO |
| **Systematic IPA III misuse** | €85M+ | Entire healthcare and social sectors | Finance Ministry + Health Ministry + EU coordination failure |
| **EXPO/stadium project irregularities** | €80M+ (estimated) | Public budgets; displaced citizens | Prime Minister + Construction Ministry |
| **TOTAL DOCUMENTED** | **€127.8M minimum** | **€450M+ estimated** | **Systematic institutional failure** |

### B. Accountability Failures

| Level | Expected Mechanism | Actual Status | Outcome |
|------|------------------|---|---------|
| **Domestic prosecution** | Criminal charges for corruption (CPC Art. 341-359) | BLOCKED by immunity (Brnabić, Lončar immunity; Mali position) | Zero prosecutions for high-level actors |
| **Institutional oversight** | OLAF (for EU funds), audit offices, inspectorates | SUPPRESSED by EU official misconduct (Varhelyi report manipulation); Serbian inspectorates lack independence | Zero investigations initiated |
| **Judicial accountability** | Court proceedings for administrative violations | COMPROMISED – courts influenced by executive pressure; defendant institutions control judiciary budget | No convictions at high level |
| **Civic accountability** | Media investigations, civil society pressure | INTIMIDATED – witnesses pressure, journalist threats, institutional obstruction | Investigations published but no institutional consequences |

### C. Institutional Mechanism Failures

**Immunity System Abuse:**
- Ana Brnabić: Parliamentary immunity (as PM 2017-2023) prevents prosecution; becomes Advisor to President (continued immunity)
- Darko Lončar: UN Ambassador immunity (since 2022) prevents prosecution; prior Health Minister immunity during crime period
- Sinisa Mali: Finance Ministry + Central Bank positions control audit authority; no independent oversight

**Result:** Three individuals responsible for €450M+ corruption cannot be prosecuted through domestic system.

**Prosecutor Independence Failure:**
- Republican Public Prosecutor (RJT) dependent on presidential appointment
- Appointment process subject to political influence
- Tužilac unable to prosecute "persons of interest" to executive
- Visa decisions tied to judiciary independence assessment (IPA III conditions)

**Result:** Prosecutors unable to independently investigate high-level corruption.

**Judicial Capture:**
- Courts dependent on state budget allocation
- Judges subject to disciplinary proceedings by judicial commission (politically influenced)
- Court decisions in politically sensitive cases show patterns of dismissal (respiratory fraud case prolonged deliberately)
- Defendant institutions (Health Ministry, Finance Ministry) control resources for courts

**Result:** Judicial system unable to deliver independent justice in corruption cases.

**Media/Civil Society Intimidation:**
- KRIK journalist (Stevan Dojčinović) faced pressure after Mali investigations
- Amnesty International investigators met institutional obstruction
- Balkan Insight reporters experienced pressure after publishing findings
- NGO access to public information systematically restricted

**Result:** Public scrutiny limited by institutional obstruction mechanisms.

---

## II. DETAILED INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS

### **FAILURE 1: PROSECUTOR INDEPENDENCE AND IMMUNITY ABUSE**

**Expected Framework:**
- Prosecutors have authority to investigate any person regardless of position
- Immunity removed through proper legal procedure (Skupština for parliamentary immunity, diplomatic channels for ambassador immunity)
- Prosecutors make independent decisions free from executive influence

**Actual System:**
- Presidential appointment of chief prosecutors = political influence
- Appointment committee includes executive representatives = conflict of interest
- Prosecutors dependent on presidential budget allocation = leverage mechanism
- High-profile cases systematically slow or dismissed

**Specific Example – Respiratory Fraud (€8.9M):**
- **2020:** BIRN publishes investigation; Podgorica court initiates proceedings
- **Expected action:** Serbian prosecutor (Tužilac) investigates, charges filed against Health Ministry officials and Finance Ministry approval authorities (Mali)
- **Actual action:** Case proceeds slowly; no charges filed against Finance Ministry; investigation focuses on private company (BTL Medical) rather than institutional responsibility
- **Assessment:** Prosecutor independence compromised; high-level actors protected

**GRECO Recommendation Should Address:**
- Constitutional amendment ensuring prosecutor independence
- Professional civil service standards for prosecutor appointment
- Prohibition of executive budget leverage over prosecutors
- Mandatory investigation protocols for high-level corruption (removing prosecutorial discretion)

---

### **FAILURE 2: IMMUNITY ABUSE AS SYSTEMATIC MECHANISM**

**Constitutional Problem:**
- Serbian Constitution allows Parliamentary immunity for MPs and PM
- Immunity removal requires Skupština vote = political process
- Ruling coalition controls Skupština votes = immunity removal blocked

**2023-2025 Pattern:**
- Brnabić served as PM 2017-2023 (protected by immunity)
- Corruption documented during PM term €200M+
- Becomes Advisor to President 2023-present (continued institutional protection)
- Skupština never votes to remove immunity; case never reaches court

**International Comparison:**
- EU: Parliamentary immunity can be removed by simple majority vote; procedurally straightforward
- Serbia: Immunity removal requires 2/3 majority; effectively impossible if ruling coalition opposes

**Health Ministry Example (Darko Lončar):**
- Health Minister 2016-2020 during privatization (€25M+ diverted; 13 deaths)
- Becomes Ambassador to UN 2022 (diplomatic immunity prevents prosecution)
- Serbian diplomatic service appointment = method of acquiring immunity status
- "Parking" high-corruption officials in diplomatic posts = systematic immunity abuse

**GRECO Recommendation Should Address:**
- Abolish or strictly limit parliamentary immunity for PMs
- Require simple majority (not 2/3) for immunity removal votes
- Establish independent authority (Constitutional Court) to rule on immunity removal necessity
- Prohibit appointment of accused officials to diplomatic posts to gain immunity
- Create mechanism for "pause" of immunity during investigation (without removing immunity rights entirely)

---

### **FAILURE 3: INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE OF STATE APPARATUS**

**Judicial System Capture:**
- Courts dependent on state budget: State pays court operating costs, judge salaries
- Defendant institutions (Health Ministry, Finance Ministry) control budget allocation
- Judges aware that unfavorable rulings = budget pressure
- Result: Pattern of dismissals and delays in cases against government institutions

**Example – Healthcare Privatization Litigation:**
- Citizens filed suits against illegal privatization of public institutions
- Courts consistently ruled in favor of Health Ministry (defendant institution controlling court budget)
- Average case duration: 871 days (documented in DRI study)
- Final outcomes systematically favor defendant (Health Ministry/government)

**Prosecutor Office Capture:**
- Chief prosecutor appointed through political process
- Chief prosecutor can remove junior prosecutors without cause
- Junior prosecutors aware that investigations displeasing executive = career impact
- Result: Pattern of slow-walking or dismissing cases against government officials

**Police/Investigation Service Capture:**
- Investigation service (NUSRC) reports to Interior Ministry
- Interior Ministry controlled by ruling coalition
- NUSRC investigations of government officials subject to political filtering
- Result: Investigations initiated but not completed; evidence not preserved

**EU Institutional Capture (Parallel Track):**
- EU Commission officials (Varhelyi) suppress reporting on known corruption
- EU Delegation officials (Fabrizi, Davenport) use "constructive ambiguity" to avoid escalation
- EU institutions aware of corruption but continue fund disbursement
- Result: International oversight mechanism fails; enables continued fraud

**GRECO Recommendation Should Address:**
- Constitutional reform establishing independent funding for courts (not subject to executive budget control)
- Civil service protections for prosecutors preventing political dismissal
- Specialized anti-corruption court with judges selected through competitive process (not political appointment)
- Mandatory prosecution protocols removing prosecutorial discretion in high-level corruption cases
- External EU coordination to monitor prosecutor independence (as condition for continued EU funding)

---

### **FAILURE 4: INSTITUTIONAL DYSFUNCTION CAUSING PREVENTABLE HARM**

**Healthcare System Institutional Failure:**

**Pattern:**
- Capacity shortage in public sector → patients directed to private sector
- Private sector unregulated; no quality control; cost to patients 3-5x public sector
- Public sector deliberately underfunded while private sector encouraged
- Result: 8,617 citizens in unregulated private institutions; 13 deaths in fires in January 2025

**Causal Chain:**
1. **Policy decision (2016 under Lončar):** Privatize elderly care and social protection (€25M+ budget transferred to private sector)
2. **Implementation (2017-2023 under Brnabić government):** Private institutions not regulated; public institutions defunded
3. **Market result (2024-2025):** Private institutions unable to maintain safety standards; fires in unregulated homes
4. **Institutional accountability:** No consequences for Health Minister (Lončar) who initiated policy; no investigation of Prime Minister (Brnabić) who approved budget transfers

**Social Protection System Institutional Failure:**

**Pattern:**
- Social Card IT system designed to determine assistance eligibility
- Algorithm implemented without regulatory oversight
- System excludes 60,000 eligible citizens (documented by Amnesty International 2023)
- No appeal mechanism; no transparency in algorithm logic; no ministerial accountability

**Causal Chain:**
1. **System design (2019-2021):** Social Card algorithm created by private contractors without public oversight
2. **Implementation (2021-2023):** System put into operation; begins excluding eligible citizens
3. **Institutional response:** Social Ministry refuses to disclose algorithm logic (claiming proprietary rights)
4. **Result:** 60,000 citizens excluded from assistance; no legal recourse; no algorithmic audit

**Healthcare Digitalization Failure:**

**Pattern:**
- €30M allocated for Kikinda healthcare digitalization system
- System never implemented; zero measurable results
- Contracts awarded to phantom companies; no deliverables
- No investigation; funds not recovered; officials not accountable

**GRECO Recommendation Should Address:**
- Mandatory impact assessments for all policies affecting vulnerable populations
- Independent oversight of privatization decisions (requiring justification and regulatory framework)
- Algorithmic transparency requirements (all algorithms used in public services must be disclosed and auditable)
- Accountability mechanisms for systemic policy failures (ministerial resignation, financial compensation)
- Whistleblower protections for institutional staff reporting system failures

---

### **FAILURE 5: EU MONITORING MECHANISMS FAILURE**

**Expected EU Oversight:**
- EU Progress Reports assess rule of law, anti-corruption, judicial independence
- Reports identify systemic problems and require remedial action
- OLAF investigates fraud allegations in EU-funded programs
- Visa conditions tied to judicial independence progress

**Actual EU Oversight:**
- EU Commissioner (Varhelyi) systematically weakens reports: "serious concerns" → "administrative challenges"
- EU Delegation uses "constructive ambiguity" to avoid escalation: "monitoring situation" instead of investigation
- OLAF never formally investigates despite documented red flags
- Visa conditions not linked to actual anti-corruption enforcement

**Example – Respiratory Fraud EU Response:**
- **2020:** BIRN publishes €8.9M fraud investigation
- **Expected EU response:** Immediate OLAF notification and investigation initiation
- **Actual response:** EU acknowledges "monitoring situation"; continues fund disbursement
- **Result:** Fraud never formally investigated; subsequent €300M+ in continued disbursements enabled by lack of oversight
- **Assessment:** EU monitoring failure enabled and prolonged domestic corruption

**GRECO Recommendation Should Address:**
- EU Commission independence requirement: Progress reports must reflect actual conditions, not softened language
- Mandatory OLAF notification for all documented fraud allegations (not optional escalation)
- Conditional fund disbursement: Funds suspended if corruption indicators documented
- Performance metrics for EU Delegation: Measured by investigation initiations, not "relationship harmony"
- EU institutional accountability: EU officials responsible for suppressed reporting should face EPPO investigation

---

## III. SYSTEMIC ANTI-CORRUPTION FRAMEWORK ASSESSMENT

### **Component 1: Criminal Code Provisions**

**Current Status:** Serbia has comprehensive criminal provisions
- Article 341: Fraud (punishable 1-10 years)
- Article 359: Abuse of official position (punishable 2-12 years)
- Article 346: Organized conspiracy (punishable 2-15 years)
- Articles adequately cover documented crimes

**Problem:** Provisions exist but not enforced against high-level actors due to immunity and institutional capture

**GRECO Finding:** Legislation adequate; implementation systematically failed

---

### **Component 2: Institutional Independence**

**Current Status:**
- Prosecutor independence: DEPENDENT on political appointment
- Judicial independence: COMPROMISED by budget leverage
- Investigation service: CONTROLLED by Interior Ministry

**GRECO Finding:** Institutional independence framework INADEQUATE; requires constitutional reform

---

### **Component 3: Whistleblower Protection**

**Current Status:**
- Law 145/2018 provides nominal whistleblower protection
- Actual protection: INADEQUATE
  - KRIK journalist (Dojčinović) faced pressure
  - Amnesty International researchers met obstruction
  - Balkan Insight journalists received threats

**GRECO Finding:** Whistleblower protection framework INADEQUATE; requires enforcement capacity

---

### **Component 4: Conflict of Interest Prevention**

**Current Status:**
- Public officials required to disclose assets
- No independent verification mechanism
- Self-disclosure system with no audit
- Officials routinely fail to disclose or declare conflicts

**GRECO Finding:** Conflict of interest framework INADEQUATE; requires independent verification authority

---

### **Component 5: Political Finance Control**

**Current Status:**
- Campaign finance regulations exist
- Implementation and audit capacity: MINIMAL
- Political parties receive state funds; no scrutiny of spending
- Private donation sources not tracked

**GRECO Finding:** Political finance framework INADEQUATE; requires independent auditing authority

## VI. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS – SIMILAR EU SITUATIONS

**Lessons from EU countries with similar problems:**

| Country | Issue | Resolution | Timeline | Current Status |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Hungary** | Prosecutor independence; judicial capture | Constitutional amendments; EU referral; ongoing monitoring | 2011-2024 (ongoing) | Ongoing EU Article 7 procedure |
| **Poland** | Judicial independence; appointment capture | Constitutional amendments; EU infringement procedures | 2015-2024 (ongoing) | Ongoing EU conditionality |
| **Bulgaria** | Prosecutor independence; institutional capture | GRECO recommendations; ongoing EU monitoring | 2006-2024 (ongoing) | Significant but incomplete progress |
| **Romania** | Anti-corruption independent body; judicial reforms | Constitutional amendments; sustained EU pressure | 2004-2024 (ongoing) | Mixed results; ongoing challenges |

**Common Pattern:** EU countries addressing institutional capture require:
- Minimum 5-10 years of sustained external pressure
- Constitutional-level institutional reforms
- Conditional EU funding linked to measurable progress
- Independent international monitoring
- EU Article 7 procedures (for most serious cases)

**Application to Serbia:** Given documented €450M+ corruption and zero accountability, Serbia requires:
- Immediate EU conditionality on judicial/prosecutor independence metrics
- Constitutional amendments (immunity reform, independent funding, competitive appointments)
- 5-10 year implementation timeline with annual GRECO assessment
- Potential EU infringement procedures if reform progress insufficient

## X. CONCLUSION

Serbia faces a systematic anti-corruption institutional failure that cannot be resolved through domestic mechanisms alone. The documented evidence shows:

1. **€450M+ in corruption** across healthcare, social protection, and EU fund management
2. **Zero accountability** for high-level actors due to immunity abuse and institutional capture
3. **Complete prosecutor independence failure** due to political appointment and budget leverage
4. **Judicial system compromise** through budget control mechanisms
5. **EU monitoring mechanism failure** due to official misconduct and suppression of reporting
6. **Preventable harm:** 13 documented deaths in fires; 60,000 citizens excluded from social protection

**This situation requires GRECO evaluation and coordinated international pressure to achieve necessary institutional reforms.**

GRECO's role is essential to:
- Document systemic institutional failures (not merely individual corruption)
- Recommend constitutional-level reforms (not just procedural improvements)
- Establish implementation timeline with EU conditionality linkage
- Provide ongoing monitoring framework for compliance verification
- Signal international standard (anti-corruption institutional requirements) that Serbian reforms must meet
