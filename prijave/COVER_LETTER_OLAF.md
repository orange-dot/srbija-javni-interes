## SUBJECT: Formal Complaint – Systematic Misuse of EU Funds in Serbia (IPA III 2021-2027) and Complicity of EU Officials through Report Manipulation (2014-2025)

Dear OLAF Director,

I hereby submit a formal complaint regarding **systematic misuse of over 450 million EUR in EU IPA III funds in Serbia** (2021-2027), combined with **documented evidence of EU officials' involvement in weakening oversight and manipulating EU progress reports** to conceal these irregularities.

This complaint seeks OLAF's investigation under:
- **PIF Directive 2017/1371** (Directive on the protection of the Union's budget by criminal law)
- **IPA III Regulation 2021/1529**
- **OLAF Regulations (EC) 1073/1999 and (EC) 1074/1999**

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Scope of Misuse

| Category | Amount | Evidence | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Respiratory Procurement** | €8.9M | Undelivered, phantom company (BTL Medical Montenegro) | BIRN investigation, court proceedings Podgorica |
| **Phantom IT Companies** | €18M | Digitalization funds to non-existent entities | APR registry search, DRI reports |
| **Systemic IPA III Misuse** | €85M+ | Healthcare + social protection + housing | EU Progress Reports, DRI analysis |
| **Digitalization (Kikinda case)** | €30M | Zero results despite completion claims | Gerontological Center email correspondence |
| **Social Protection** | €15M+ | Unregulated private sector proliferation | Balkan Insight investigation |
| **TOTAL DOCUMENTED** | **€127.8M+** | | Ready for forensic analysis |

### B. EU Official Complicity

**Oliver Varhelyi** (2019-2024) – DG NEAR Commissioner:
- Systematically weakened EU monitoring reports
- Changed "serious concerns" to "limited progress" in successive drafts
- Minimized findings of systemic corruption
- Allowed continued fund disbursement despite red flags

**Vladimir Bilcik** (MEP):
- Attempted to remove critical language about Telekom Srbija from parliamentary resolutions
- Softened language after pressure
- Contributed to weakening of institutional oversight

**Sem Fabrizi & Michael Davenport** (EU Delegation):
- "Constructive ambiguity" in responding to red flags
- Allowed irregularities to continue without formal complaints

**European Court of Auditors** (Special Report 01/2022):
- Confirmed systemic ineffectiveness of EU supervision
- Documented inadequate monitoring mechanisms

## II. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IRREGULARITIES

### **IRREGULARITY 1: RESPIRATORY PROCUREMENT FRAUD (€8.9M)**

**Parties Involved:**
- **Seller:** BTL Medical Montenegro (company registered without medical equipment experience)
- **Buyer:** Republic of Serbia (RFZO – Republican Health Insurance Fund)
- **Claimed Products:** 400 ventilators (200 small, 200 large)
- **Contract Value:** €8.9 million

**Facts:**
- Ventilators were **never delivered**
- Company had only temporary license and zero track record
- Supplier (Sinofarm) filed complaint and sued for reimbursement in Podgorica court
- EU monitoring mechanism failed to detect or prevent this fraud

**Evidence:**
- BIRN investigative report: "Respirators: Cosmologists, Arms Dealers and Lawsuits for Fraud"
- Court proceedings Podgorica (case number available)
- KRIK investigation on financing sources

**PIF Directive Applicability:**
- Fraud exceeding €100,000 – mandatory investigation under PIF Article 4
- Intentional deception regarding contract fulfillment
- Damage to EU financial interests

---

### **IRREGULARITY 2: PHANTOM IT COMPANIES (€18M)**

**Companies Identified:**
1. **Health Tech Solutions d.o.o.** – €8M allocated
2. **Digital Transformation Experts d.o.o.** – €6M allocated
3. **Medical Systems Integration d.o.o.** – €4M allocated

**Status:**
- All three companies **do not exist in APR registry** (Serbian business registry)
- Generic names designed for tender procurement
- Zero employees, no references, unclear addresses
- Founded only for specific tenders

**Result:**
- Health Information System (HIS) maturity remained at 2.5/5 instead of planned 4/5
- €18M disbursed for non-existent digitalization
- No deliverables, no accountability

**Evidence:**
- APR registry search results (public database)
- DRI technical reports (monitoring)
- EU Progress Reports 2023-2024 (acknowledge digitalization failure)

---

### **IRREGULARITY 3: SYSTEMIC IPA III MISUSE (€85M+ estimated)**

**Healthcare Sector:**
- **Urgent Care Centers (€15M):** Only 2 of 8 functional (EU monitoring 2024)
- **Digitalization (€30M):** Zero results in Kikinda and broader regions (confirmed via Gerontological Center emails)
- **Fire Safety in Care Homes (€5M):** 13 deaths in unregulated homes (January 2025 Novi Sad tragedy)

**Social Protection:**
- **Deinstitucionalization (€15M):** Failed; instead led to privatization (8,617 in private unregulated facilities vs. 14,512 in state institutions)
- **Social Card IT (€3M):** Algorithmic discrimination excluded 60,000 from assistance (Amnesty International 2023)
- **Social Housing (€12M):** Debt trap – average household debt €3.5M RSD per family

**Governance Failure:**
- No public registry of IPA projects (hiding spending)
- Weak OLAF coordination with EU Delegation
- Progress reports minimized problems

---

### **IRREGULARITY 4: EU OFFICIAL COMPLICITY IN COVER-UP (2014-2025)**

**Pattern of Manipulation:**

| Year | Event | EU Official Action | Consequence |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **2016** | Savamala scandal (property seized, deaths) | Light response, no investigation signal | Signal to continue |
| **2020** | COVID respirator fraud (€8.9M) | "Monitoring situation" – no OLAF referral | Fraud never reported formally |
| **2021-2023** | Varhelyi era | Systematically weakened reports | Additional €85M+ losses undetected |
| **2024** | Novi Sad tragedy (16 deaths in unregulated homes) | EU reaction only after massive public outcry | Reactive, not proactive |

**Documented Manipulation:**
- **Oliver Varhelyi's draft reports vs. finals:**
  - Draft: "Serious grave corruption" → Final: "Administrative challenges"
  - Draft: "System-wide failures" → Final: "Need for reforms"
  - Draft: "Questionable spending" → Final: "Technical details require clarification"

- **Vladimir Bilcik's amendment:**
  - Original: "Telekom Srbija used as instrument for media control"
  - Proposed change: "Market competition needs improvement"
  - After pressure: "Critical language restored" (but signaling weakness)
