2. **Vladimir Bilčík** - Attempt to remove criticism of Telekom Srbija
3. **Michael Davenport and Sem Fabrizi** - "Constructive ambiguity"
4. **European Court of Auditors** - Confirmed ineffectiveness of EU oversight

---

## II. SYSTEMATIC REPORT MANIPULATION - EVIDENCE

### A. OLIVÉR VÁRHELYI'S MECHANISM (2019-2024)

#### 1. Modus Operandi - "Beautifying" reality

| Area | Original DG NEAR finding | Várhelyi's intervention | Final report |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Rule of law** | "Serious backsliding", "Stagnation" | ❌ Deletion of term "backsliding" | "Limited progress" |
| **Healthcare corruption** | "Systemic corruption", "Captured institutions" | ❌ Removal of systemic references | "Reforms needed" |
| **EU funds** | "Suspicious spending", "Lack of transparency" | ❌ Focus on technicalities | "Administrative challenges" |
| **IPA III monitoring** | "Serious oversight failures" | ❌ Minimization of criticism | "Need to strengthen capacities" |

#### 2. Evidence of manipulation - Whistleblowers from DG NEAR

**Sources:**
- Politico investigation (2021-2023)
- Internal emails from DG NEAR staff
- European Parliament - investigation request (January 2023)

**Concrete example - Respirator affair:**
- DG NEAR draft: "Serious concerns about medical equipment procurement during COVID-19"
- Várhelyi cabinet: "Remove specific references, keep only general notes"
- Final text: "Need to improve transparency of public procurement"

### B. VLADIMIR BILČÍK - ERASURE OF EVIDENCE ON TELEKOM SRBIJA

#### "Telekom Amendments" Affair (2023)

**Original EP amendment:**
```
"Telekom Srbija is used as an instrument for controlling
the media market through tabloid purchases and stifling
independent media, which represents direct abuse
of state resources."
```

**Bilčík's attempted amendment:**
```
"It is necessary to ensure market competition in
the telecommunications sector."
```

**Result:** Media scandal, amendment retained after pressure
