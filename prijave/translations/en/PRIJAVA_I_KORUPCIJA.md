## IV.A. SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION EXTENDED TO SOCIAL PROTECTION - SAME SCHEME

Corruption in healthcare is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a wider pattern of systemic budget abuse that extends to the social protection system. It is documented that the same mechanisms (fund diversion, algorithmic discrimination, false EU reporting) operate in social protection:

### 1. ALGORITHMIC DISCRIMINATION - "SOCIAL CARD" AS A SAVINGS MECHANISM

The implementation of "Social Card" in March 2022 under Prime Minister Ana Brnabić's administration represents a classic example of how corruption uses "modernization" as a facade for reform:

**Documented results (Amnesty International, December 2023):**
- ~60,000 citizens lost the right to social assistance through algorithmic system
- Algorithm treats temporary family transfers as "income" which eliminates all state assistance rights
- Particularly affected vulnerable groups: Roma community, persons with disabilities
- Result is not "better targeted assistance" but **exclusion of 30% of previous users from the system**

**Similarity to healthcare corruption:**
- Just as healthcare budget was "diverted" from needed services to phantom projects
- Social budget was reduced through algorithmic exclusion instead of transparent policy
- In both cases: **The most vulnerable are most affected** (disabled, elderly, children, Roma community)

### 2. SOCIAL HOUSING - DEBT TRAP INSTEAD OF ASSISTANCE

Parallel to healthcare system - while "social protection funds" are mentioned, in practice something that looks like assistance is provided that actually is a mechanism for further impoverishment:

**Documented situation - Zemun Polje/Kamendin (A11 Initiative, August 2025):**
- 600+ citizens in "social housing" that are actually debt traps
- City provides 30% subsidy only if utility bills are paid IN FULL - impossible for those on assistance
- Result: Utility debt exceeds 3.5 million RSD per household
- Punishment: 60+ families without electricity; some tenants without power for over 10 years
- Final result: Forced evictions instead of assistance

**Corruption mechanism:**
This scheme is perfect corruption because:
- It looks like "assistance" to the public
- In practice it is **a mechanism for destroying entire households**
- Allows city authorities to claim "we gave them housing"
- Actually: They give housing that residents cannot afford, then take it back through debt

### 3. INSTITUTIONAL PRIVATIZATION - NEW THEFT SCHEME

While deinstitutionalization started in 2011 with the goal of closing facilities:
- What happened: **Trans-institutionalization** - instead of closing institutions, **private homes** were opened
- Number of people in institutions remained similar (14,512 + 8,617 = ~23,000)
- But money was diverted from public systems to private companies
- Result: **Same segregation, but now "privatized" and paid through public funds**

**Evidence:**
- MDRI-S, Human Rights Watch: 14,512 in state, 8,617 in private institutions
- No real progress in 15 years (2011-2025) of deinstitutionalization
- Instead of developing community housing (with support), private homes expanded (without support)

**Corruption mechanism:**
Instead of true deinstitutionalization (schools, community housing, support), the system allows:
- Private companies to create small homes that look "better" than large ones
- Public funds to continue financing segregation, just now "privatized"
- Government to claim "deinstitutionalization" while structure remains segregated

## V. EVIDENCE

### Already secured:
1. **Letter from Gerontology Center** - non-existence of digitalization
2. **Medical documentation** - all personal cases
3. **EU monitoring reports** - suspicions of fraud
4. **APR data** - phantom companies
5. **ASK reports** - 45 accounts of S. Mali
6. **RFZO false information** - Sanja Radak De Jongx stated on 09.08.2023 that there is no obligation to maintain statistics of rejected patients, contrary to Law on Administrative Procedure Art. 211

### To obtain through investigation:
1. Bank transfers to offshore accounts
2. Contracts with phantom companies
3. Communication with EU about false reporting
4. Financial flows to private clinics

---

## VI. WITNESSES

### Key:
- **Dr Mihailo Jovanović** - actual state of digitalization
- **Dr Vladimir Suvajac** - private surgery prices
- **Prof. dr Lazar Popović** - Milja Janjatović case
- **Dragana Jevremović (RFZO)** - rejection procedures
- **Sanja Radak De Jongx (RFZO)** - issued false information that there is no obligation to maintain records of rejected patients (09.08.2023)

### Additional:
- Families of 13 fire victims
- 60,000 citizens on waiting lists
- EU Delegation staff (anonymously)
- Healthcare workers (protected witnesses)

---

## VII. INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION

### OLAF can:
- Block further EU funds
- Demand return of €50 million
- Initiate independent investigation
- Ensure international pressure

### EU already suspects:
**European Court of Auditors (2025):**
> "High risk of fraud in Serbian health sector"

**EU Delegation (2024):**
> "Discrepancies between reported and observed"

---

## VIII. DEMANDS

### URGENT:
1. **Initiate investigation** for all unknown persons
2. **Block accounts** of suspects
3. **Protect witnesses** (especially Dr Jovanović)
4. **Coordinate with OLAF** on EU funds

### SYSTEMIC:
1. **Confiscate property** acquired through crime
2. **Return money** to healthcare system
3. **Prosecute** all participants
4. **Reform** public procurement system

---

## CONCLUSION

This criminal complaint proves that healthcare corruption is not abstract but **KILLS PEOPLE**:

- **13 DEAD** because money for fire safety was stolen
- **60,000 WAITING** because money for equipment was stolen
- **FAMILIES SUFFERING** because the system is destroyed by corruption

EU funds are only additional evidence of the scope of plunder. While officials steal millions (dinars and euros), citizens die.

**Every day the prosecutor delays = new deaths, new suffering.**

I demand URGENT ACTION before the number of victims increases.
