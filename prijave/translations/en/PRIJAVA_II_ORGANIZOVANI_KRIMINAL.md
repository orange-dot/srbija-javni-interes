## III.A. PRIVATE HOMES AS PART OF ORGANIZED SCHEME - INSTITUTIONAL PRIVATIZATION

In addition to health funds, the same organized group uses privatization of institutional homes as a mechanism for continuous criminal activity. Trans-institutionalization - replacing public institutions with private ones while segregation remains - represents a more structural scheme than individual fund thefts.

### 1. SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS OF INSTITUTIONAL PRIVATIZATION

**Documented data (Source: MDRI-S, Human Rights Watch, DRI reports):**
- State institutions: 14,512 persons in institutional care
- Private institutions: 8,617 persons in institutional care
- **Total:** ~23,000 persons in institutions (same or higher number as 2011, before "deinstitutionalization")
- Timeline: 2011-2025 = 15 years without progress
- International standard: Deinstitutionalization means CLOSING institutions and developing community housing
- Serbian practice: Deinstitutionalization means TRANSFER FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE institutions

### 2. FINANCIAL FLOWS - PUBLIC MONEY INTO PRIVATE POCKETS

**Criminal mechanism:**

Instead of using the budget for community housing with support (as required by international standards), the same budget is diverted to private homes, whereby:

1. **Public sector impoverished:** Budget for institutional care remains approximately the same, but is depleted (because private providers profit)
2. **Private sector enriched:** Private homes financed by public funds but without public control
3. **Segregation continues:** Persons remain in institutions, just now in "private" rather than "public" ones
4. **Government can claim "reform":** Government can claim "deinstitutionalization is underway" while structure remains segregated

**Evidence of organization:**
- MDRI-S Policy brief: Privatized homes have no better standards than public ones
- Balkan Insight, August 25, 2025: "40% of persons in institutions could live independently with support, but:
  - Community housing is not funded (~27 persons in 145 municipalities)
  - Private homes are expanding (because privatized funds are more accessible)
  - The result is 'trans-institutionalization' instead of 'deinstitutionalization'"
- A11 Initiative: Shows that alternative (NGO) models like "Zvuci Srca" cafeteria work, but are donor-dependent because they lack systematic funding

### 3. CONNECTION TO HEALTHCARE ORGANIZED SCHEME

The same group creates "private" healthcare institutions which they then use as "private clinics", whereby:

1. **Public healthcare budget is directed toward "private" sector** (owners are the same group, just different businesses)
2. **Private clinics become "overloaded" because they are the only accessible ones** (because public system is diverted)
3. **Patients are forced into private procedures** (because public system cannot provide)
4. **Result:** Two streams of money into the same pockets:
   - Public funds → private homes (for institutional care)
   - Public funds → private clinics (for private surgeries)

**Example:** Private homes can be "established" as public institutions but financed as private, while persons in them remain segregated (same segregation, just privatized).

### 4. MECHANISM OF ORGANIZED SCHEME

**Phases:**

**Phase 1 - Establishment (2011-2015):**
- "Private" companies for managing homes are created
- Owners are business partners of ministers/RFZO directors
- Falsely presented as "reform" and "deinstitutionalization"

**Phase 2 - Financing (2015-2020):**
- Public budget for institutional care is "divided" between public and private
- Public homes become underfunded
- Private homes remain funded but without public control

**Phase 3 - Expansion (2020-2025):**
- Private homes develop while public ones deteriorate
- Government claims "deinstitutionalization is underway"
- Reality: segregation is just privatized

### 5. COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME - SAME GROUP MANAGES MULTIPLE SECTORS

The same officials who steal from healthcare also steal from institutions:

| Sector | Scheme | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Healthcare** | Phantom health companies for "digitalization" | €30M stolen, 0% results |
| **Institutions** | Private homes publicly funded | 8,617 persons without standards, segregated |
| **Social assistance** | "Social Card" algorithm excluding 60,000 | Budget reduced without transparency |
| **Housing** | "Social housing" becomes debt trap | 3.5M RSD debt per household |

**Connection:** All these sectors operate through the same ministers (Mali, Lončar, Brnabić, Grujičić) with the same scheme - privatization of funds through "reforms" that look good to the public but are actually mechanisms for transferring public money into private pockets.

### 6. INTERNATIONAL CONSEQUENCES

- **EU funds for deinstitutionalization** are used to finance private expansion instead of alternatives
- **Responsibility:** Serbia is obliged to implement EU/CRPD standards (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities)
- **Scheme is special because:** IT LOOKS LIKE REFORM (privatization = modernization, "decentralization") while actually being budget diversion
- **Important:** Difference between "privatization as reform" and "privatization as scheme":
  - **Reform:** Private sector should be better/cheaper/more transparent
  - **Scheme:** Private sector is just a transfer point for the same money to the same people with less control

### 4. CONTINUITY (2021-2025)
