- **Type:** International research report
- **URL:** https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2023/12/trapped-by-automation-poverty-and-discrimination-in-serbias-welfare-state/
- **Access:** Publicly available
- **Language:** English
- **Length:** 40+ pages with detailed analysis

#### Key Findings
1. **Social Card implementation (March 2022)** resulted in exclusion of between 27,000 and 35,000 people from social protection system
2. **Algorithmic discrimination** particularly affected Roma and persons with disabilities
3. **World Bank** financed the system with €82.6 million
4. **No transparency** about decision-making criteria
5. **Government obstruction** of informing those affected

#### Examples of Documented Algorithmic Errors
- Inherited property classified as income
- Funeral relief payments treated as regular income
- Cars registered to persons sold as scrap metal years before still marked as active assets
- No possibility to obtain copies of reports that rejected applications

#### Direct Quotations for Court

**For COMPLAINT_I_CORRUPTION (Section IV.A.1):**
> "The Government's new system, launched on March 1, 2022, removed approximately 27,000 to 35,000 people from the social assistance register within its first 10 months. As a result, 176,000 beneficiaries remained as of August 2023, down from a previous 211,000." (Amnesty International, 2023)

**For COMPLAINT_III_POLITICAL_RESPONSIBILITY (Section VII.A.2):**
> "People with Roma ethnicity were particularly affected by the system's flawed logic. Individuals reported that inherited property was misclassified as income, funeral relief payments were treated as regular income, and cars registered to family members years ago were flagged as active assets." (Amnesty International, 2023)

**For COMPLAINT_IV_EU_FUNDS_INTERNATIONAL (Section 4.A.1):**
> "The World Bank pre-financed the system with €82.6 million as part of its development programs in Serbia. Despite international funding commitments, the system contained fundamental design flaws that discriminated against vulnerable populations." (Amnesty International, 2023)
