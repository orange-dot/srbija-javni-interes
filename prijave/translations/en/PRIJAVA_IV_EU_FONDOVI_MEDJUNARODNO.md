## 4.A. SYSTEMIC INSTITUTIONAL DYSFUNCTION - BROADER EU CONCERN

Analysis of EU funds for Serbia (2021-2025) reveals that corruption is not limited to the health sector but represents **systemic dysfunction** extending through healthcare, social protection, and housing. This suggests the problem is deeper than individual fraud and requires comprehensive EU investigation.

### 1. PATTERN ACROSS SECTORS - €450M+ SYSTEMICALLY MISUSED

| Sector | EU Allocation | Problem | Result | Victims |
|--------|--------------|---------|----------|-------|
| **Health - Digitalization** | €30M | 0% realized | Health system not modernized | 60,000 on waiting lists |
| **Health - Emergency centers** | €20M | 2 of 8 centers functional | Patients rejected from emergency | Deaths due to unavailability |
| **Health - Fire protection homes** | €5M | Money disappeared, homes without protection | 13 dead in fires | Elderly persons |
| **Social protection - Deinstitutionalization** | €15M (estimated) | Trans-institutionalization instead of deinstitutionalization | 8,617 persons in private institutions without standards | Persons with disabilities |
| **Social protection - Social card IT** | €3M (estimated) | Algorithmic system that excludes instead of targeting help | 60,000 lost rights | Poorest households |
| **Housing - Social housing** | €12M (EU + domestic) | Cities create debt traps instead of protection | 3.5M RSD debt per household | Poor families |
| **TOTAL MISUSED FUNDS** | **€85M+** | **Systemic corruption across 3 sectors** | **No visible progress in any sector** | **Millions in Serbia** |

### 2. CLOSED-LOOP PROBLEM - How Corruption Creates Circular System

```
HEALTH SECTOR COLLAPSES
    ↓
Budget for health redirected to "prestige projects"
    ↓
SOCIAL PROTECTION BECOMES SUBSTITUTE FOR HEALTH
(psychiatric hospitals as temporary "housing")
    ↓
DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION ALTERNATIVE BECOMES PRIVATIZATION
(instead of closing institutions, replaced with "private" homes publicly financed)
    ↓
HOUSING THAT SHOULD BE SUPPORT BECOMES DEBT TRAP
("social housing" with impossible payment terms)
    ↓
RESULT: Same number of persons in institutions as 2011, only "privatized"
PLUS: 60,000 lost social protection
PLUS: 600+ in debt traps
```

**EU Conclusion:** This is not "corruption in healthcare" - this is **SYSTEMIC DYSFUNCTION** where corruption enables total institutional failure.

### 3. EU STANDARD VS. SERBIAN PRACTICE

**EU Standard (CRPD - Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities):**
- Deinstitutionalization = CLOSING institutions + developing community housing
- Social protection = ACCESSIBLE to all with needs + IT for transparency
- Housing = ACCESSIBLE with support, not debt trap

**Serbian Practice (2021-2025):**
- Deinstitutionalization = Transfer to "private" institutions (same segregation)
- Social protection = Algorithmic exclusions (+60,000 lost) instead of "targeting"
- Housing = City gives apartment appearing as help but actually engineered (debt → eviction)

**Conclusion:** Serbia has '''inverted''' EU standards - claimed deinstitutionalization and "reforms" that are actually mechanisms for budget cuts with people as victims.

### 4. FINANCIAL FLOWS - WHERE EU FUNDS ACTUALLY GO

Instead of being used for "reforms" as stated to EU Commission, EU funds are used for:

1. **Healthcare:** Phantom companies for "digitalization" (€30M) → actually money returns via offshore accounts
2. **Institutions:** "Private" homes publicly financed (€15M) → money goes to private owners connected to decision-makers
3. **Social protection:** "Algorithmic" IT systems for "targeting" (€3M) → result is exclusion of 60,000 persons
4. **Housing:** "Social housing" as "help" (€12M) → result is debt traps with evictions

**Scheme:** EU funds → Local "reformers" (Mali, Lončar, Brnabić, Grujičić) → Private sector/offshore → Return as "reform"

### 5. RED FLAGS FOR EU - BROADER INVESTIGATION

This complaint suggests that OLAF should consider the FOLLOWING as **SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS** rather than individual cases:

1. **Transparency Problem:** Serbia has no public registry of how EU funds are used
2. **Accountability Problem:** Leaders with immunity (Mali, Lončar, Brnabić, Grujičić) are protected from accountability
3. **Sectoral Problem:** Scheme repeats (health → institutions → social → housing)
4. **Pattern Problem:** Every "reform" results in more segregation/exclusion instead of less

### 6. EU REQUIRED RESPONSE

This complaint demands that EU:

1. **Stop new allocations** until corruption is halted
2. **Demand fund recovery** for all unfulfilled projects (minimum €85M)
3. **Ensure oversight** directly through EU bodies (not through domestic partners)
4. **Investigate immunity** as mechanism enabling systemic corruption (Mali, Lončar, Brnabić, Grujičić are protected from prosecution)
5. **Call on Serbia** to reform "immunity" legislation blocking justice
