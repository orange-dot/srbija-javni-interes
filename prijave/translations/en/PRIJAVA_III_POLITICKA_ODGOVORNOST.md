## SUBJECT: Systemic political responsibility for 13 deaths and suffering of 60,000 citizens

I hereby submit a criminal complaint regarding political responsibility of the highest state officials (2021-2025) whose conscious political decisions have led to:
- **13 DEATHS** in fires due to absence of basic protection
- **60,000 citizens** sentenced to years of waiting and disability
- **Collapse of the healthcare system** despite available resources
- **Misuse of €50 million** in EU assistance intended to save lives

---

## I. POLITICAL CONTEXT - CONSCIOUS SACRIFICE OF HEALTHCARE

### FACTS ABOUT PRIORITIES

#### HEALTHCARE (basic state function):
- 2021: 350 billion RSD
- 2025: 280 billion RSD
- **Reduction: 70 billion RSD (-20%)**

#### PRESTIGE PROJECTS (luxury):
- Stadium: 180 million EUR
- Fountains: 20 million EUR
- EXPO: hundreds of millions EUR
- Metro: billions of EUR

**PERVERSITY:** While 60,000 wait for surgery, fountains are being built.

### POLITICAL DECISIONS THAT KILL

#### 1. DECISION: "Ban on hiring in healthcare"
**Consequence:**
- Kikinda: from 14 to 7 medical workers
- 24h coverage reduced to 8h
- Complainant's mother died without palliative care

#### 2. DECISION: "Reduction of healthcare budget"
**Consequence:**
- No money for fire safety equipment → 13 dead
- No money for surgeries → 60,000 waiting
- No money for medicines → Milja J. died

#### 3. DECISION: "EU funds for 'digitalization'"
**Reality:**
- €30 million "invested"
- 0% digitalization
- Paper procedures continue

### FALSE REPRESENTATION TO EU

#### Serbia reports to EU:

## VII.A. EXTENDED SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS - SOCIAL PROTECTION COLLAPSE AS SYSTEMIC CONSEQUENCE

Political responsibility of those who made decisions (2021-2025) cannot be limited to the healthcare sector alone. The same decision-making mechanism and absence of accountability was applied to the social protection system, which further proves intentional collapse of institutional systems.

### DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION: 15 YEARS WITHOUT PROGRESS

According to publicly available data from international organizations and independent research:

**Documented situation (2025):**
- 14,512 persons in state institutions (MDRI-S, Human Rights Watch)
- 8,617 persons in private institutions (trans-institutionalization - segregation through privatization)
- 33,212 annual admissions to psychiatric hospitals (using healthcare system as substitute for social protection)

**Responsible political decision:**
Serbia started deinstitutionalization reform in 2011 with the goal of closing large institutions and developing community services. However:
- Regular budget decisions by Mali/Lončar/Brnabić/Grujičić did NOT prioritize development of alternative services
- Instead, budget was directed toward "prestige projects"
- Result: **Still 23,000+ persons live in institutions**, same or worse situation than 15 years ago

**Internationally documented:**
Disability Rights International (DRI) and Mental Disability Rights Initiative Serbia (MDRI-S) in reports "Serbia's Forgotten Children" (2021) and "Torment not Treatment" (2007-2025) detail conditions in institutions: segregation, neglect, restrictive measures, medication abuse, deprivation of treatment, denial of right to decide about one's own life.

### HOUSING CRISIS - SOCIAL HOUSING WITHOUT SOCIAL PROTECTION (Zemun Polje Case Study)

A11 Initiative for Economic and Social Rights published in August 2025 a detailed investigation into the "social housing" system that became a debt trap instead of assistance:

**Documented situation - Kamendin (Zemun Polje):**
- 600+ residents in Belgrade's largest social housing settlement
- City of Belgrade provides 30% subsidy only if bills are paid IN FULL - impossible for those on social assistance
- Result: Accumulated utility debts exceed 3.5 million RSD per household
- Consequence: 60+ families without electricity; some tenants without power for over 10 years
- Punishment: Citizens face forced evictions

**Responsible political decision:**
"Social housing" system is not a real protection system - it is a mechanism that:
- Gives people housing but they cannot afford maintenance costs
- Requires payment of full utility costs to receive subsidy
- Lets people accumulate debts for years
- Applies forced evictions as "solution"

Mali/Lončar/Brnabić/Grujičić all diverted budget from sustainable social protection to other priorities, enabling this model to continue without reform.

### AUTOMATED DISCRIMINATION - SOCIAL CARD (Algorithmic exclusion)

Brnabić's tenure as Prime Minister (2021-2022) was marked by introduction of "Social Card" in March 2022, a system that:

**Documented situation (Amnesty International, December 2023):**
- ~60,000 citizens lost the right to cash social assistance through algorithmic system
- Government has 176,000 remaining in system (35,000 fewer than March 2022)
- System treats temporary transfers (family solidarity) as "income" that disqualifies
- Particularly affected vulnerable groups: Roma community, persons with disabilities

**Political decision:**
Instead of being a means of targeted assistance, Social Card became a tool for REDUCING budget expenditures by excluding the most vulnerable. While the fact that a person receives temporary family assistance practically eliminates all right to state assistance, this creates a paradox where:
- Persons in family solidarity → disqualified
- Persons without family network → not better off

Algorithmic system replaces human assessment of need, which Amnesty International qualifies as systemic abuse.

### ROLE OF IMMUNITY - MECHANISM FOR ENABLING SYSTEMIC FAILURE

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**

These three areas (healthcare, social protection, housing) show a consistent pattern from 2021-2025:
1. Deficient policies adopted by Mali/Lončar/Brnabić/Grujičić
2. Warnings from international organizations, NGOs, healthcare professionals, activists
3. **IGNORING warnings without consequences**
4. Continuation of deficient policies

**What can this be attributed to?**

Parliamentary immunity - which protects Mali/Lončar/Brnabić/Grujičić - enables this pattern:
- If there is immunity: no accountability for policy
- If no accountability: no real consequences for making bad decisions
- If no consequences: policy continues without substantial change because decision-makers can avoid risks
- Result: Systems degrade, lives are damaged, and decision-makers remain untouched

In cases where immunity could theoretically be lifted, the procedure is so political that it is practically powerless - requires Parliament to lift immunity, which requires government consent.

**Conclusion for this section:**
Continuous collapse of three critical systems (healthcare, social protection, housing) from 2011 to 2025 is not coincidence - it is the result of a systematic approach where immunity enables making harmful decisions without consequences. When accountability can be avoided through immune status, there is no motivation to change policies even when evidence of harm is abundant.

- Publicly condemn
- Demand accountability

### WHO CAN:
- Publish critical report
- Send urgent mission
- Activate international assistance

### COUNCIL OF EUROPE:
- Human rights (right to health)

---

## X. DEMANDS

### FROM PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE:
1. **Establish** political responsibility for decisions
2. **Interview** all ministers and prime ministers 2021-2025
3. **Document** link decisions-consequences
4. **Prosecute** for consequences on lives

### FROM EU/INTERNATIONAL BODIES:
1. **Suspend** funds until accountability
2. **Demand** independent investigation
3. **Publish** findings
4. **Condition** further assistance on reforms

### IDENTIFICATION OF RESPONSIBLE:
- All signatures on decisions
- All signatures on EU reports
- All statements about "good condition"
- All who could have prevented

---

## XI. SPECIAL FOCUS - COMPARISON

### SERBIA vs REGION

#### CROATIA (similar resources):
- Waiting lists: maximum 6 months
- Digitalization: 75% actual
- EU funds: 85% utilization

#### SERBIA:
- Waiting lists: 2-5 YEARS
- Digitalization: 0% despite €30M
- EU funds: disappeared

**CONCLUSION:** Problem is not in resources but in POLITICAL WILL.

---

## CONCLUSION

This complaint proves that political decisions are not abstract - they **KILL**:

- **13 DEAD** = political decision about priorities
- **60,000 DISABLED** = political decision about budget
- **SYSTEM COLLAPSE** = political decision about "savings"

While politicians build fountains and stadiums:
- **People burn** in homes
- **People die** on waiting lists
- **Families suffer** without treatment

**Political responsibility is not an option - it is an OBLIGATION.**

Every day without accountability = new hypocritical decision, new victims.

**STOP THE POLITICAL MURDER OF THE PEOPLE!**
